            <description><![CDATA[<p>We’re following a slightly modified version of the popular gitflow approach.</p>

<p>We use a code review process, based on a merge/pull requests feature supported
by gitlab/github where a feature will be reviewed based on a merged request from
the feature branch to the develop branch. Which is a cool and easy approach to
do code reviews. Where reviewer and feature author keep discussing the comments
and see the changes revisions till the feature is accepted and thus merged into
the develop branch by the reviewer. Also the diffs and all merge details will
stay there forever for reference purposes, even if the source branch
(feature-branch) is deleted.</p>
